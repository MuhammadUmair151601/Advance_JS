// Iterators are used in place of normal loops as we know the normla loops are not in our handle it prints all the values which we want while in iterators we can manually get the value by our own choice:
// Example:
// var x = ["a","b","c","d"];
// let y = x[Symbol.iterator]();
// console.log(y.next());
// let a = 12;
// let b = 12;
// let sum = a + b;
// console.log(sum);
// console.log(y.next())
// Now i printed the value of 1st index after doing an operation in the code:
