// var is a global scope variable accessed from all over the code can be redeclared:
// let is a blocked scope variable cannot be redeclared:
// const has a fixed value with no re declaration and its also blocked scope:


// Template strings or literals are now used in ES6 version:
// instead of using the old fashioned concatination method we use temp literals:
// Example:
// let name = "M.umair";
// console.log(`Hello ${name} how are you:`)


// Arrow functions are now also introduced in ES6 and has made the life easy and simple:
// Example
// let sum = (a,b) => a + b ;
// console.log(sum(12,12))

// let statement = () => {
//    console.log("I am a software engineer and i am not fine right now:")
// }
// console.log(statement())
// NOTE:
// use {} when statement is more than one line:
